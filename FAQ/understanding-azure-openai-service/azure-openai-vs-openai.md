## Your data, is your data 

Azure OpenAI does not use your data to retrain models, ensuring that your data remains private and secure. Your prompts, completions, embeddings, and training data are not shared with other customers, OpenAI, or used to improve OpenAI models or any Microsoft or third-party products. When you fine-tune Azure Open AI models with your training data, these models are exclusively available for your use. 

Azure Open AI leverages the robust security capabilities of Microsoft Azure, including region transparency for compliance reasons, so you know exactly where your data is stored and processed. 

## Enhanced Security 

Azure Open AI includes content filtering and abuse monitoring features to maintain the integrity and safety of the services provided. Content filtering and abuse monitoring features in Azure OpenAI maintain service integrity and safety, providing an additional layer of protection against AI misuse. 

## Conclusion 

Azure Open AI Service combines the advanced capabilities of OpenAI models with enhanced security, compliance, and data privacy features offered by Microsoft Azure. Users of Azure Open AI can benefit from the power of AI models while ensuring that their data remains private and secure.
