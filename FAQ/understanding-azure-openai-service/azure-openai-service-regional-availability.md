The Azure OpenAI Service is available in various regions, with specific models and capabilities offered in various locations. Some Azure Open AI services like GPT 4 models and GPT 3.5 models are available in specific regions like Sweden Central, East US, and Canada East. Knowing the deployment regions is crucial for choosing the right model. 

## GPT-4 Models 

Most of the GPT-4 models are available in all Azure regions. However, if you are looking for specific models, knowing the region where they can be deployed is crucial. For example, in Sweden Central, you can find five models including GPT-4 Vision and GPT-4 Turbo. These models can be deployed in Australia East, Japan East, Sweden Central, Switzerland North, and West US.  

## GPT-3.5 Models 

For GPT-3.5 models, there are multiple regions to choose from. East US and East US 2 are good options, but if you specifically need GPT-3.5 Turbo, East US is the only region that offers it. The latest GPT-3.5 Turbo models are available in Canada East, North Central US, and South-Central US. 

## Other models: Embedding and text-to-speech models 

Newest models for embeddings are found in regions like Canada East and East US 2, while other models like Dalle.E and Text-to-Speech are best used in North Central US.
