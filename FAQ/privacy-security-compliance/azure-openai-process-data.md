# How does Azure OpenAI service process data? 
The Azure OpenAI service allows users to integrate their own data, enabling customized insights and searches. It leverages various AI models to provide accurate and relevant responses in natural language. 

Azure supports integration of user-added data into different applications and workflows are supported, enabling monitoring of data performance and usage. Once users have added their data, they can integrate it into different applications and workflows. Additionally, users can monitor their data and its performance and track its impact on different processes. 

## Using Azure AI Studio to add your data 

- Go to Azure AI Studio 

- Create a new project and deploy your models: GPT-35-Turbo and ada-embedding-model 

- Navigate to chat and click on add your data.  
- Click on add a new data source. You will get an option to add your own data whether through uploading your own files, using Azure AI Search or even Azure Blob storage. Follow the instructions and you will be able to successfully upload your data. 

## Monitoring and Evaluation  

In Azure AI Studio, users can monitor their data and track its performance by integrating their own data into different applications and workflows. This allows users to see how their data is performing and track its usage. Additionally, users can also add connections to Microsoft Azure to further enhance their data monitoring capabilities. 

## Conclusion 

It is essential to highlight Microsoft's commitment to user privacy and data security. When users upload their data to the Azure OpenAI service, Microsoft ensures that the data is not used for training purposes or to customize existing models. This approach safeguards user data and maintains the integrity of the service.
