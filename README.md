# Startups guide to Azure
This repo provides startups with Azure guidance, information, and resources. Whether you're creating something brand new, you're considering a move from another cloud provider, you want to leverage Azure services, you're refactoring your architecture, or you're throwing everything away and starting over, this guide will help you.

## Get started with Azure
You can quickly get started with Azure by [creating a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). The free account includes access to 25 different products that are always free. You also get free access to popular Azure products for 12 months. And you get a $200 credit to spend in the first month. For the latest details on the free Azure account, consult the [Azure Free Account FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/).

If you already have an Azure subscription, you don't need to create a new account.

## What does Azure have to offer?
Azure has a broad range of products that cover many different scenarios, capabilities, and needs.

With a free account, you get access to two tiers of products, *free* and *free for 12 months*:

- [Products that are always free](products/azure-products-free.md)
- [Products that are free for 12 months](products/azure-products-free-trial.md)

With an Azure subscription, you get access to all of the free products and the products that are pay-as-you-go. To help you make sense of it all, we've curated a list of Azure products that we think are particularly relevant to startups:

- [AI and ML](products/azure-products.md#ai-and-ml)
- [Blockchain](products/azure-products.md#blockchain)
- [Compute](products/azure-products.md#compute)
- [Containers](products/azure-products.md#containers)
- [Databases](products/azure-products.md#databases)
- [Data Engineering](products/azure-products.md#data-engineering)
- [Developer tools](products/azure-products.md#developer-tools)
- [Infrastructure management and automation](products/azure-products.md#infrastructure-management-and-automation)
- [Internet of Things](products/azure-products.md#internet-of-things)
- [Networking](products/azure-products.md#networking)
- [Security](products/azure-products.md#security)
- [Storage](products/azure-products.md#storage)
- [Web](products/azure-products.md#web)

All of the products are compiled in the full curated list of [Azure products](products/azure-products.md).

### You have your first customer?
Free services are not limited to development or testing (see our [Free Services FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/)). So yes, you may go into production with our free services. Be sure to check if the limits & availability of used services are sufficient for your use case before. Also, please note that you'll not be eligible to refunds if there is any SLA breach. Check out our [SLA documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/) for more information.
