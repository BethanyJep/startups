# Startups guide to Azure
This repo provides startups with Azure guidance, information, and resources. Whether you're creating something brand new, you're considering a move from another cloud provider, you want to leverage Azure services, you're refactoring your architecture, or you're throwing everything away and starting over, this guide will help you.

## Getting started with Azure for free
Azure has lots of services included in the free tier.
`TODO: Explain the free tier. Some services are free for 12 months, others are always free. Curate the list.`
`TODO: Could the MS Learn collections be aligned specifically with the free tier services?`

## Learn about Azure
[Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?products=azure&resource_type=learning%20path) is a great resource for learning everything there is to know about Azure.
