# Startups guide to Azure
This repo provides startups with Azure guidance, information, and resources. Whether you're creating something brand new, you're considering a move from another cloud provider, you want to leverage Azure services, you're refactoring your architecture, or you're throwing everything away and starting over, this guide will help you.

## Getting started with Azure
You can quickly get started with Azure by [creating a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). The free account includes access to many [products for free](azure-products-free.md). [Other products](azure-products-free-trial.md) are offered with a 12 month trial, after which they are paid services. The free Azure products are always free. You also get $200 in credits for the first 30 days.

## Azure products for startups

Azure has a broad range of products that cover many different scenarios, capabilities, and needs. The curated [list of products](azure-products.md) identifies a set of the products that are particularly relevant to startups. Many of the products are available in the free tier, but most require a paid Azure subscription.
